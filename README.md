## Entries

Each entry is its own file, with the `.md` extension. Entries live in the `entries` directory. Entries can be placed in nested subdirectories.

Entries have YAML front-matter with the following keys:

- name: the formal name for the entry
- url: the URL where you can find the entry
- imageUrl: the original source of the image associated with the entry
- tags: an array of tags (which must appear in tags.yaml)

The body of the entry's file is Markdown which is treated as the description for the entry.

To add an image, add it with the same filename, but with the `.png`, `.jpg`, etc. extension.
